## Group Project: Pitch Ideas

### AI Resume Tailoring

What problem or pain point does it solve? - This project will solve the pain point of matching your resume to a specific job posting. This can be a pain staking process that requires a lot of time and attention to detail. By giving chatGPT the context of your resume and a given job posting it should be able to match langugage between the two.

Minimum Viable Product (MVP) definition. - For the MVP we should only need to take in a job posting and a resume and return an updated resume.

What is the minimum required for you to present on your demo day? - We will only need 1 resume (not it!) and 1 job posting, to receive an updated resume. Ideally we will want to show more, but that's the bare minimum.

### Chatbot with Dall-E

What problem or pain point does it solve? There are a number of chatbot services out there but they are limited to text and this holds back the creative process. By incorporating character drawn by Dall-E users should be able to create more immersive stories.

Minimum Viable Product (MVP) definition. - Our product would need to be able to show a conversation between multiple characters and use a Dall-E representation of each character while their text is displayed.

What is the minimum required for you to present on your demo day? - We would need to have our characters displaying with their Dall-E avatar and text generation from openAI working.

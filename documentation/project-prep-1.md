# Project Prep 1 - Team Agreement

## Contributors - Rafael Aldana, Tyler Bennett, Brenda Jow, John Chavez, Ash Uppal

## Cooperation Plan

What are the key strengths of each person on the team?

1. Rafael - Adaptability
2. Tyler - CSS
3. Brenda - Good Listener
4. John - Organization
5. Ash - Perseverance

How can you best utilize these strengths in the execution of your project? - We think the best way to maximize these varied strengths is for us to combine out talents with pair/mob progamming.

In which professional competencies do you each want to develop greater strength? -

1. Rafael - Technical Confidence
2. Tyler - Communication
3. Brenda - Written Communication
4. John - Networking
5. Ash - Career Development

Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work? - By maximizing collaboration with pair/mob programming as our default we should be able to keep everyone apprised of the day-to-day work. When mob programming we will stop to solicit input from everybody to mitigate the verbal chaos of that format.

## Conflict Plan

What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises? - We should be able to handle disputes by getting all 5 team members together and coming to a democratic solution. If we are not able to handle it amongst ourselves then we will consider elevating the issue to the instructional staff.

What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute? - If one person is not able to contribute we will have them drive during our pair/mob programming sesssions. If they are unable/unwilling that is something that would need to be discussed and potentially elevated to the instructional staff.

How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level? - Not only do we understand that we can't all be at the same level in all these technologies at the same time, we are counting on it. By working primarily in groups we should be able to distribute that knowledge amongst the group.

How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing? - This should be addressed at our daily standup, particularly when we are looking at daily commits/PRs to make sure everyone will have a noticeable contribution.

How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful? - Luckily at CodeFellows we have an instructional staff who can help us to resolve otherwise unresolvable issues.

## Communication Plan

Describe at least:

What hours will you be available to communicate? - Standard time class time we will meet in remo, Slack is on the table for non class hours.

What platforms will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)? Slack and Remo will be our primaries.

How often will you take breaks? - 10 minutes per hour for each break.

What is your plan if you start to fall behind? - If we start to fall behind we plan on using a more divide and conquer approach to catch up to our schedule. We also have the TA's available to help us with any technical challenges holding us back.

How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend? - After hours and weekends Slack will be the expectation, with no expectation of a response. That time is participation-optional.

What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voice is heard? - We think that our morning standup should be a good time to hear everyone speak.

How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up? - Again at our morning standup everyone will have a chance to speak and hopefully they feel comfortable airing their concerns in that time.

## Work Plan

Our plan is to try and get every member at least one commit/PR per day. We will take note of the volume of PRs and commits during our standups to ensure that everyone has a similar contribution.

## Collaboration Plan

How you will identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general? -We will use Trello for to assign and check off tasks. They will be assigned in the morning during out standup.

What project management tool will be used? - We will be using [this Trello board](https://trello.com/invite/polishedprofiles1/ATTI69ab10d218e8cd35ee8aa3b5122a67686E051C3B)

Presentation Deck
Make a single copy of the Presentation Deck Template. Share your copy will all team members, so everyone is working from the same file.

Link to the shared doc in your project plan. [Our Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1h_3UdScy-ufChhC7IRLBd9isdb5nfOgpm4_Z3x-VHH4/edit#slide=id.g2accd1c413_3_31)

## Git Plan

What components of your project will live on GitHub? Our codebase will be split into two repositories, one for front end and one for backend.

How will you share the repository with your teammates? - Via a GitHub organization.

What is your Git flow? - New features will be built on separate branches then merged to dev. When the group thinks we have a made a significant leap with our polished project we will merge to main.

How many people must review a PR? - 3 people must review a PR to main.

Who merges PRs? - PR's should be merged by the remaining group member (whoever has not reviewed or submitted the PR).

How often will you merge? - Ideally we will merge at the end of every day.

How will you communicate that it’s time to merge? - We should be able to find a stopping point for the day and agree whether or not the project is in a state where we feel comfortable merging it.

This step must be completed and approved before proceeding with any project work. Notify your instructor when this is ready for review.
